# CONTROLLING-THE-SPEED-OF-CONVEYOR-BELT-DC-MOTOR-USING-POTENTIOMETER
This project presents an experimental stand for the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control of a dc motor used for driving a conveyor belt. It uses potentiometer to vary the voltage. Here, accelerating is much more natural by rotating the accelerator (via a potentiometer) than by just pushing buttons. For supplying the DC motor, the PWM signal is generated by an ARDUINO UNO board, equipped with an ATmega328 microcontroller.
